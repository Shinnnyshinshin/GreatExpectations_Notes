# Overview

This document is so that I can understand the structure behind Great Expectations is that I have to understand the structure of the code and what it does. 

https://docs.greatexpectations.io/en/latest/intro.html


### Here are the list of things that Great Expectations can do, according to the Introduction.
* Save time during data cleaning and munging.
* Accelerate ETL and data normalization.
* Streamline analyst-to-engineer handoffs.
* Streamline knowledge capture and requirements gathering from subject-matter experts.
* Monitor data quality in production data pipelines and data products.
* Automate verification of new data deliveries from vendors and other teams.
* Simplify debugging data pipelines if (when) they break.
* Codify assumptions used to build models when sharing with other teams or analysts.
    - this would be very very helpful 
* Develop rich, shared data documention in the course of normal work.
    - is this something that is automatically generated? 
* Make implicit knowledge explicit.
